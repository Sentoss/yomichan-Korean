# Korean [Yomichan](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan) dictionaries

I forked the krdict for yomichan repository in order to include it and add other dictionaries.

What I did was use Pyglossary to change Korean Stardict dictionaries (quick kr-en, quick en-kr, kr-kr dictionaries) to become yomichan dictionaries in order to boost yomichan's functionality/support for Korean.

Yomichan overpowers Stardict with its Anki cards creation support, so I said "why not increase its support for Korean?"
